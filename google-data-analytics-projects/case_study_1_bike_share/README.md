### 🔍 Steps in the Analysis
1. **Ask:** What is the business problem?
   - How can Cyclistic convert casual riders into annual members?

2. **Prepare:** 
   - Source: Divvy bike data (public datasets from [divvy-tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html))
   - Cleaned and combined 12 months of CSV files.

3. **Process:** 
   - Removed missing values and outliers.
   - Added new calculated columns (ride_length, day_of_week, etc.).

4. **Analyze:** 
   - Compared average ride duration and frequency between user types.
   - Identified peak usage times and popular stations.

5. **Share:** 
   - Created visualizations using Tableau/Matplotlib.

6. **Act:** 
   - Suggested targeted marketing strategies to increase memberships.
